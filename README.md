# Football-World-Kings-2
 A global football manager simulation game featuring all leagues, clubs, and nations worldwide — inspired by Football Manager and FIFA Career Mode.
Football World Kings is a global football management simulator where players control clubs and national teams across every continent. The game includes all leagues, clubs, and national teams from Africa, Europe, Asia, North America, South America, and Australia.

Manage your squad by assigning real jersey numbers, captains, and tactics. Only the best get legendary numbers like 10 and 7. Track derbies, trophies, and achievements such as Palandios and Ballon d’Or awards through multiple seasons, starting from 2025–2026 and continuing forever.

Experience real football life: player injuries (ACL, hamstring, etc.), home issues, and sponsor negotiations. Sign sponsorships with Nike, Adidas, Puma, or Coca-Cola for your team, stadium, and league. Sponsors can expire or renew depending on your club’s success.

Clubs can gain new rich owners, instantly boosting budgets into billions, regardless of size. Build history by honoring club legends with statues, retired numbers, and hall of fame inductions.

Manage manager transfers, handle press conferences, and lead your team to domestic and continental glory. Compete in real global competitions like the Champions League, CAF Champions League, Copa Libertadores, and World Cup.

Your goal is simple: become the greatest football manager ever — winning leagues, derbies, trophies, and Ballon d’Ors while growing your club’s legacy across generations. Every number, captain, and legend counts in Football World Kings.
